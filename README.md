# WaW-Stock-Map-Script-Placer

A tool for creating custom Stock Map - Mods.

## Installation

Download WaW-Stock-Map-Script-Placer.zip
Extract WaW-Stock-Map-Script-Placer.zip, it contains a folder so don't worry about tons of files going everywhere.

Download base_files.zip
Extract base_files.zip, it contains a folder so don't worry about tons of files going everywhere.

Open WaW-Stock-Map-Script-Placer folder, drop base_files folder into _internal folder.

## Usage

Go into _internal folder, then into json folder, open config.json and replace the directory with your own waw root directory.

Run WaW-Stock-Map-Script-Placer.exe

Input mod name

Decide whether you want (all of these optons are optional):;
- whether you want a waw exe shortcut sent to your desktop with predefined args so you can load right into map via running said shortcut.
- the mod built/compiled, it does the same thing as the stock launcher.
- insert an in-game print message to confirm build. this will just add a few lines of code to mapname.gsc so when you run the map it will print a message which will indicate that the build was successful. if you check build mod, as well as this option, but dont see the in-game print message, then the build failed.
- automatically have the map run after mod has been created.

Select one of the maps in the mode-specific sections.
